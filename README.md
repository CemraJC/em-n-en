If you're a writer, then you need the Em and En dashes. This ultra-simple program makes it easy for you to just type the dash and move on. It does this in a variety of ways - you choose which one's you like.

#### List of Ways to Make Some Dashes:

| Method name    | How to do it |
| :---------:    | :----------: |
| Modifier keys  |  <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>-</kbd> for **En dash** (–) <br> <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>-</kbd> for **Em dash** (—) |
| Inline Replace |  Type `--=` for **En dash** (–) <br> Type `==-` for **Em dash** (—) |
| Hard Replace   |  Replaces hyphen (-) with **En dash** (–) all the time (*this is probably a bad idea*) |
